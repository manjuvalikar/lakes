currently managed by MAPSAS trust with support from the surrounding
communities.


The lake is part of the Parappana Agrahara series, Kasavanahalli lake

              The Citizen Lakes Dashboard Project is a joint project undertaken by ATREE, Yuktix Technology and Biome Environmental Solutions. The objective is to create an open source platform on lake data that can inform citizens groups on how much water is actually entering and leaving lakes and real-time information on lake water quality.
How can citizens engage?</p>

Citizen Lakes Dashboard Project
Context on Urban Lakes
Bengaluru city has experienced unprecedented growth in recent decades. If the city is to sustain growth and claim its position as a global high-tech city, it must be able to secure sufficient water supply and also create a healthy livable environment with opportunities for recreation. 

</p>

<p>
At present, the bulk of Bengaluru's public water supply is from the Cauvery, but it is supplied mainly to within the BBMP boundary; whereas many of the newly developing peri-urban areas remain borewell dependent and groundwater there is depleting quickly. Similarly, many parts of the greater Bengaluru metropolitan area lack underground sewerage and functioning storm water drain networks. So, untreated sewage enters lakes, creating huge unsanitary water bodies, which are public health hazards.  During heavy rain events, low lying parts of the city get flooded causing damage to life and property.

</p>
<p>

In this context, the restoration of Bengaluru lakes has been promoted as a panacea for its flooding, water stress, and wastewater problems. They are the receptacles of storm water and sewage, but also serve as storage and recharge structures. It has been argued that lakes can store storm water and recycled wastewater and avoid the need for potentially destructive, expensive schemes that may destroy biodiversity rich aquatic ecosystems and forests.  
In recent years there has been a groundswell of citizen's movements in and around Bengaluru to conserve and protect its lakes, for largely aesthetic reasons. In fact, the lakes are some of the last remaining public "green spaces" in the city greatly improving the quality of life of citizens. In the last few years, many of Bengaluru's lakes have been officially handed over to citizen groups who have been appointed trustees of the lake.

</p>

<p>
Historically, lakes have played a major cultural role and even served as drinking water sources. But despite their central role, Bangalore lakes are getting degraded due to discharge of domestic sewage, industrial effluents, surface runoff carrying pesticides, immersion of idols etc. This has resulted in deterioration of water quality, sedimentation, decrease in aquatic flora and fauna, loss of aesthetic value and tourism potential.  There is also some evidence that deteriorating quality in lakes is contaminating groundwater with adverse impact on the health of residents in nearby localities, which depend on groundwater.
